## Project Name: Analyzing and Visualizing Global CO2 Emissions for Environmental Impact
To create a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes global CO2 
emissions data, providing insights for policymakers, researchers, and the public to understand 
emission trends, identify key contributors, and support efforts in mitigating climate change.


### Problem Statement:

- Data Complexity: Global CO2 emissions data is complex, encompassing various sources, sectors, and regions. It is essential to handle large datasets that include historical data, different types of emissions, and multiple geographic regions.

- Trend Analysis: Identifying trends and patterns in CO2 emissions over time is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of current policies and initiatives, and for planning future actions.
- Key Contributors: Pinpointing the major contributors to CO2 emissions, such as countries, industries, and activities, is necessary for targeted intervention and policy development
- Impact Visualization: Presenting the data in an accessible and understandable way to various stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, and the public, to foster awareness and drive action.
- Comparative Analysis: Providing the ability to compare emissions between different countries, regions, and sectors to highlight disparities and best practices.
